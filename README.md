## Part 1 - Background

### The efficient market hypothesis and the role of earnings

Earnings (surprises) have an impact on firm valuations. Consistent, abnormal returns, however, would be at odds with the efficient market hypothesis ([Fama, 1970](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635020303750#b96)). According to the (semi-strong form of the) efficient market hypothesis (EMH), all publicly available information is instantaneously impounded into the price and, as a result, no market participant can expect abnormal excess returns in the long run. Evidence contradicting the well-established EMH, therefore, constitutes an anomaly.<sup>1</sup>

### Introduction to the PEAD

The Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift (PEAD), which [Fama (1998, p. 286)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635020303750#b97) calls the “granddaddy of underreaction events”, is one of the most puzzling anomalies in finance. PEAD refers to the phenomenon that stock prices tend to continue to drift upward (downward) following earnings announcements when the quarterly earnings were above (below) expectations. This is why the anomaly is often called the ‘SUE-effect’, for standardized unexpected earnings (others call it the ‘earnings momentum effect’). The PEAD was most convincingly demonstrated by [Bernard and Thomas, 1989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635020303750#b35), [Bernard and Thomas, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635020303750#b36).<sup>1</sup>

Stocks react to earnings surprises with a price adjustment, reflecting the new information contained in the announcement. ```However, only a portion of the adjustment happens immediately. Empirical studies find that the adjustment can take months to level out, which leads to the distinct drift pattern of stock prices. The direction and magnitude of the drift and the earnings surprise are directly related.``` When grouping a universe of stocks into quantile portfolios by the magnitude of their earnings surprises (from most negative to most positive earnings surprise), the quantile appears to be strongly related to the drift direction and magnitude. The drift is also economically significant. Early evidence shows that a strategy of zero-investment portfolios, long (short) in stocks with the most positive (negative) earnings surprise, can generate annualized abnormal returns of 18% ([Bernard and Thomas, 1989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635020303750#b35)).<sup>1</sup>

### General characteristics of the PEAD

1. The PEAD is a global phenomenon.
2. The abnormal return of the PEAD was around 4% per quarter in the past, but may be disappearing.
3. The PEAD used to persist for multiple quarters but research now typically focuses on the quarter directly following the announcement.
4. The strength of the PEAD is ```inversely``` related to firm size.:+1:

   > Finally, recent evidence suggests that, at least for large, liquid US stocks no significant PEAD can be observed anymore ([Martineau, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635020303750#b175))
  
5. Earnings surprises used to detect PEAD can be defined via ```earnings time series```, ```analyst forecasts```, and ```returns```.:+1:
6. PEAD is a separate anomaly, not subsumed by others.

### Potential drivers of the post-earnings-announcement drift

1. Insufficient risk adjustment typically does not explain abnormal returns.
   > [Ball et al. (1993)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635020303750#b22) assert that betas increase for firms with high unexpected earnings and decrease for firms with low unexpected earnings. An increase or a decrease in beta (or risk) can then explain the seemingly abnormal returns after earnings announcements. However, while SUE-decile and beta seem to be rank-correlated, the effect is relatively weak and can only explain a small fraction of the abnormal returns.
2. Information uncertainty leads to an underreaction to earnings news, and the delayed reaction results in PEAD.:+1:
3. Trading frictions (```transaction costs```, ```liquidity```) are positively related to PEAD and partly explain it.:+1:
4. Information processing costs cannot explain the PEAD.
5. Active institutional ownership weakens PEAD.:+1:
6. Investors fail to incorporate, or underestimate earnings autocorrelation.
   > Experiments show that subjects (MBA students) generally underestimate autoregressive and moving-average components of a Brown–Rozeff time series [(Maines and Hand, 1996)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214635020303750#b173).
7. Naive expectations are more prevalent in unsophisticated investors.
8. Underestimation of earnings autocorrelation depends on the level of autocorrelation.
9. Analysts (and managers) exhibit biases that are similar to those found in the market.
10. ```Standardized unexpected earnings(SUE)``` autocorrelation and drift are stronger when earnings surprises are driven by cash flow (as opposed to accruals) or revenue (as opposed to expense) surprises.:+1:
11. PEAD returns can be affected by firm characteristics such as past PEAD, reputation, and celebrity status.
12. Accounting practices and earnings management lead to variations in PEAD returns.
13. Sensitivity of earnings to inflation can partly explain the PEAD.
14. Limited investor attention contributes to the PEAD.
15. Overconfidence bias and cultural dimensions contribute to the PEAD.
16. ```The disposition effect``` affects the PEAD.
17. Anchoring and recency bias affect PEAD.
